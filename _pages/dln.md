## Personal experience

As a freshman starting to discover my interest, I came across the course digital humanities. With each class, I am learning how to effectively utilize technology in my daily and academic life. Growing up in the digital age, I have always been familiar with various social media platforms, and online tools for content creation. However, I never truly understood the potential of technology for research data management, data manipulation, and analysis until I started taking this introductory course in digital humanities.

In my daily life, I use social media platforms like Instagram and Snapchat to connect with friends and family, to learn new things from people, and to tackle boredom. But I have never realized the blessing of having such platforms, unitl COVID hit. Without social media, we wouldn't have known what is happening in the world, we would lose contact with our loved ones, and most crucially, we wouldn't have continued our education. And for those reasons, I  appreciated the convenience and accessibility of such platforms. However, I have also become more aware of the potential risks and limitations of relying too heavily on social media, such as the impact on mental health and privacy concerns.

I'm a person who isn't really into taking pictures, I enjoy living in the movement and enjoying my time as it is. But for educational purposes, I got fimiliar to certain apps to create content for school projects and podcasts. 

In terms of research data management, I have primarily relied on Google Drive for storing and organizing my academic papers and projects. This is because it was easier for me to submit my papers directly, and because it has amazing features where documents can be shared with multiple people. I have also used Notability on my Ipad for notetaking and it had helped me so much especially if I wanted to share my notes with my classmates. Furthermore, I come to the realization that the tools I'm using may potentially be insuffecient if used for complex data analsis, thanks to this course.

The digital humanities course will continue to open my eyes to the vast array of technology and tools available for research data management and analysis. I'm eager to learn about the tools such as Tableau and Gephi for data visualization and network analysis, as well as programming languages like Python and R for data manipulation and analysis. 

I have no prior experience with technology and newfound knowledge in regards to digital humanities, but I'm excited to learn and expand my skills and knowledge in the field. With technology advancing more each day, I am fascinated by the potential of using these tools to revolutionize the way I approach and analyze data, and I am eager to learn how to apply them in my academic and professional life.


In conclusion, as a university student taking an introductory course in digital humanities will definetly be eye-opening and enriching. I have come to appreciate the potential of technology for research data management, data manipulation, and analysis, and I am eager to continue learning about how to effectively utilize these tools in my academic and professional life. While I have some basic skills in content creation and social interaction, I am aware that there is still much more to learn and I am eager to continue to expand my knowledge and abilities in this area.
