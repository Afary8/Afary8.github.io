## Personal experience

As a freshman discovering my interests, I came across the course digital humanities. With each class, I learned how to effectively utilize technology in my daily and academic life. Growing up in the digital age, I was always familiar with various social media platforms and online tools for content creation. However, I never truly understood the potential of technology for research data management, data manipulation, and analysis until I started taking the introductory course in digital humanities.

In my daily life, I used social media platforms like Instagram and Snapchat to connect with friends and family, to learn new things, and to tackle boredom. But I never realized the blessing of having such platforms until COVID hit. Without social media, we wouldn’t have known what was happening in the world, we would lose contact with our loved ones, and most crucially, we wouldn’t have continued our education. For those reasons, I appreciated the convenience and accessibility of such platforms. However, I also became more aware of the potential risks and limitations of relying too heavily on social media, such as the impact on mental health and privacy concerns.

I'm a person who isn't really into taking pictures; I enjoy living in the moment and savoring my time as it is. But for educational purposes, I got familiar with certain apps to create content for school projects and podcasts.

In terms of research data management, I primarily relied on Google Drive for storing and organizing my academic papers and projects. This was because it was easier for me to submit my papers directly, and because it had amazing features where documents could be shared with multiple people. I also used Notability on my iPad for note-taking, and it helped me so much, especially when I wanted to share my notes with my classmates. Furthermore, I came to the realization that the tools I was using might potentially be insufficient if used for complex data analysis, thanks to this course.

The digital humanities course continued to open my eyes to the vast array of technology and tools available for research data management and analysis. I was eager to learn about tools such as Tableau and Gephi for data visualization and network analysis, as well as programming languages like R for data manipulation and analysis and Kepler as a mapping tool.

I had no prior experience with technology, and newfound knowledge in regards to digital humanities, but I was excited to learn and expand my skills and knowledge in the field. With technology advancing more each day, I was fascinated by the potential of using these tools to revolutionize the way I approached and analyzed data, and I was eager to learn how to apply them in my academic and professional life.

As a university student taking an introductory course in digital humanities was definitely eye-opening and enriching. I came to appreciate the potential of technology for research data management, data manipulation, and analysis, and I was eager to continue learning about how to effectively utilize these tools in my academic and professional life. While I had some basic skills in content creation and social interaction, I was aware that there was still much more to learn, and I was eager to continue to expand my knowledge and abilities in this area.

With my knowledge advancing, I would now like to share how this course advanced my knowledge in this discipline. As I embarked on my journey into the world of digital humanities, my introductory course provided me with a comprehensive overview of the field, challenging me to rethink the intersection of technology and the humanities. This transformative experience was complemented by insights from “The Digital Humanities Course” by Drucker, a seminal text that guided my exploration. Drucker’s book, in particular, presented invaluable perspectives on the field of digital humanities.

In Chapter 1 of “The Digital Humanities Course,” Drucker offered a comprehensive overview of digital humanities, setting the stage for a deeper understanding of the discipline. This chapter helped me grasp the interdisciplinary nature of digital humanities and how it served as a bridge between traditional humanities and cutting-edge technology. It reinforced my belief that the potential of digital humanities in reshaping research and analysis was profound.

Chapter 6, which delved into information visualization, was particularly enlightening. It explored the power of visual representation in data analysis, shedding light on the art of conveying complex information in a comprehensible and engaging manner. Drucker’s insights in this chapter resonated with my growing interest in data visualization tools like Tableau. I learned that effective information visualization is not just about making data look appealing; it’s about conveying meaningful insights that can shape decisions and understanding.

In addition to these chapters, my course delved into several key topics, such as text editing, digital textual analysis, data modeling, and visualization. Text editing skills are essential in digital humanities, as they enable researchers to work with and manipulate a wide range of textual sources, and we used posit cloud in order to complete this assigment. In addition,  Digital textual analysis equips us with tools and methods to analyze texts in novel ways, unveiling patterns and themes that might not be immediately apparent. Data modeling and visualization, as I discovered, are crucial for making sense of complex data and presenting it in a coherent and visually engaging manner. These skills are invaluable for those who aim to leverage technology for research and analysis.

Lastly, we encountered a project that opened our eyes and challenged our creativity. The "unproject" is an assignment where we had to come up with a project and implement things we learned in the course. Me and my partner did our project on the Henna industry, where we are collecting data of different henna designs around the world, and by using image recongition and AI, we will produce new henna desgigns which then will be made into stencils for people to use. This "unproject" made us think outside the box, and open up new ideas where we can potentially turn this project into a real business. 

In essence, my journey in the field of digital humanities has been an eye-opening and enriching experience. It deepened my appreciation for the potential of technology in reshaping research, analysis, and communication in the humanities. Drucker’s book, with its insightful chapters, was a guiding light throughout this journey, giving me a wonderful start to the major of interactive media. And I'm proud to say that after this class, I will be majoring in interactive media.
